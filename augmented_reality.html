        <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
            Augmented reality (AR) is the technological process of adding virtual elements to the real world, usually via a headset, mobile device or pair of glasses. 
            Modern examples include; <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/thread/11554255?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps live view</a>, 
            which allows you to hold your phone up and see on the screen when and where you need to turn while walking; 
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens" target="_blank">Microsoft Hololens</a>, a headset that lets you place windows style applications around your workspace 
            and have them remain where you left them (attached to a wall for example) and also allows you to manipulate and interact with virtual objects using your hands; 
            and the once immensely popular mobile game <a href="https://www.pokemongo.com/en-au/" target="_blank">Pokémon GO</a>, where Pokémon could be displayed in the real world 
            using your phone's camera.
            <br>
            <br>
            The short term future of augmented reality is in mobile AR. Google's ARCore and Apple's ARKit are increasing their install base every month and 
            the required hardware is being installed on more and more phones; where in the past only top end, $1000+ phones were equipped with AR capabilities, 
            now, for example, the $750 iPhone SE 2020 and $450 Motorola Moto G8 mid range devices have full AR support. Applications of mobile AR include; commerce, so the customer
            can visualise the product in the real world before purchasing (Ikea already does this with their <a href="https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050" target="_blank">
            Ikea Place</a> app); and education, where books can have sections that pop out in AR, supplying the reader with more information that cannot be included with
            the book like detailed charts and videos for non-fiction books, or animations and interactivity for fiction books.
            <br>
            These changes are made possible by the continued proliferation of this technology in homes, included in technology people already own such as phones. The 
            main stumbling block of Virtual Reality is the investment in a $600+ headset and tracking system, which is a wasted investment if the technology doesn't take 
            off. Companies including AR in products consumers otherwise want to own and showing them simple, real world uses for this technology opens consumers minds 
            to AR and allows businesses to make services (apps, accessories, etc.) that take advantage of AR as they can be sure there is an established install 
            base for the required tech. This avoids the chicken and the egg problem (consumers won't buy a product with no support, but companies wont support a technology
            that nobody is buying) a lot of new technology developments face.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>
            This technology will have huge impacts on related insudtries. The technology industry will need to adapt to the new paradigm presented by AR. If this 
            technology replaces the standard computing systems availiable today; laptops, desktops and mobile, the way IT systems are designed will need to changes 
            fundamentally as the desktop metaphor cannot be easily applied to AR. Public service industries such as healthcare and education will be benifitted by
            AR. A surgeon could use AR glasses with a heads up display (HUD) to display patient vitals such as heart rate, X-rays, etc. Teachers will be able to show students 3D 
            models representing concepts they are teaching like, in a history class, a 3D representation of a World War Two tank or a view of a battlefield that 
            students could walk through.
            <br>
            In the short term AR will only effect those who chose to utilise it. Nobody will be effected by someone else utilising AR to  pick a new bed from Ikea.
            In the long term however, if AR replaces the current computing paradigm, it will most likely effect everyone who needs to use a computer, which is the 
            vast majority of the 1st world population. The change will be analogous to the proliferation of personal computers in the 80's and 90's, where those 
            already alive had to adapt to an entirely new way of doing business, but people raised alongside computers mostly have a working understanding of them.
            <br>
            AR will primarily change the nature of certain jobs rather than create or make jobs redundant, it is augmentation after all.

        <h2>How does it affect me?</h2>
        <p>
            I personally use the Google Maps live view mentioned above for navigating the unfamiliar Melbourne streets (at least I did, before the quarantine), 
            and I've played many AR games such as Pokémon GO. As an aspiring software developer, I will required to adjust my programs to match the new paradigm
            if AR takes over from the current desktop system. My family and friends will be forced to learn the new system to be able to use technology. Some may 
            resist this but it will ultimately prove nessecary if AR becomes the dominate computing platform. My grandarents would be particularly resistant to 
            change and in fact, may not even bother (it took my maternal grandmother until two years ago to get a smartphone, and even still, it remains turned off in
            a drawer most of the time). My friends, being more technologicaly literate than my family, would likely adapt to AR and probably even be early adopters 
            of the technology. My father works as an automotive machinist and could possibly use a HUD similarly to a doctor to view diagrams and instructions while 
            working on an engine.
